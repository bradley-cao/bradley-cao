I'm Bradley, an undergrad CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Previously, I was a lead student systems administrator for the TJHSST [Computer Systems Lab](https://github.com/tjcsl). Nowdays, I enjoy tinkering around with a variety of technologies on both the software and hardware side. Specifically, I am interested in a variety of fields, including but not limited to full stack development, embedded systems, quantitative finance, and AI/ML. Outside of programming and school, I am a (semi-competent) competitive swimmer competing with Georgia Tech Swim Club. Feel free to check out my [website](https://bradleycao.dev), or reach out to me [here](mailto:bradleycao@gmail.com).
