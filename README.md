### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bradley, an undergrad CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Previously, I was a lead student systems administrator for the TJHSST [Computer Systems Lab](https://github.com/tjcsl). I have also conducted serious game development through internship. Nowdays, I enjoy tinkering around with a variety of technologies on both the software and hardware side. Outside of programming and school, I am a (semi-competent) competitive swimmer competing with Georgia Tech Swim Club. Feel free to check out my [website](https://bradleycao.dev), or reach out to me [here](mailto:bradleycao@gmail.com).
